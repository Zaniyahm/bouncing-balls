User-Controlled Evil Circle: Take control of an evil circle that can devour the bouncing balls. Can you catch them all?

Generic Shape Object: We've introduced a versatile Shape() object that serves as the foundation for both the bouncing balls and the evil circle. This demonstrates your object-building skills and promotes code reusability.

Score Counter: Keep track of your performance with a built-in score counter. The goal is to capture as many balls as possible before they escape!

Getting Started
To run the game locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

Open the project directory:

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Start playing! Control the evil circle with your keyboard and try to capture as many balls as you can.

Game Controls
Evil Circle Movement:
Use the w key to move the circle upward.
Use the s key to move the circle downward.
Use the a key to move the circle to the left.
Use the d key to move the circle to the right.
Code Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

index.html: The main HTML file containing the game canvas and script references.
style.css: Stylesheet for the game layout.
script.js: JavaScript file containing the game logic, including the Shape object, bouncing balls, and user-controlled evil circle.
